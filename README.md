# Moodle Video activity

Easily embed and track videos from Vimeo, YouTube, a URL, or your [repositories](https://docs.moodle.org/403/en/Repositories).

### Advanced activity completion
Configure your videos to have special criteria for completion. Use one or more of the following criteria:

* View the video activity
* Play the video
* Watch a percentage of the video
* Completely watch the video
* Watch for a certain amount of time

Pair this with "Prevent fast-forward" for more control over the learning experience.

### Resume
Learners can easily continue watching from where they left off.

### Video player customization
Configure which player controls are available to the learner

### Consistent watch experience
The video player has the same interface for all video types (e.g. Vimeo and YouTube embeds look the same.)

### Prevent fast forwarding
Ensure your learners don't miss any content by enabling "Prevent fast forwarding". They can rewind and seek up to the furthest point they have watched.

### Comment section
Allow learners to discuss or provide feedback with comments.

### Privacy support
This plugin optionally tracks learner watch metrics. Privacy support is fully implemented for GDPR compliance.

## FAQ

### Why should I use this plugin when I can embed videos myself?
Embedding videos is perfectly fine! This plugin is the Mercedes of video embedding.

#### Will this plugin support older versions of Moodle? 
This plugin will _likely_ work with 3.11 and 3.10 with some minor tweaks. The main reason I haven't tested on these versions is because it breaks the CI process. 3.11 is already years old and is no longer supported. However, if there is enough interest I will add support for older versions. I highly recommend staying up-to-date if possible.

#### Should I use this plugin or mod_videotime?
I was the original develop of VideoTime, which offers many features at a premium. I have also built other proprietary Moodle video plugins for clients over the years. 
My goal with this plugin is to give back to the community by making all features free, forever. At this point I cannot recommend one plugin over the other,
but I do anticipate adding more features to this plugin over time.
